# `engine/v2/evaluation`

## Ownership

Implements the **Evaluation/portfolio — realized outcomes, capital accounting, report generation** row of the §4 owner table of
[system rearchitecture](../../../guides/system_rearchitecture.md), at layer
**6** of §4.1.

Replaces (§4.4): `evaluate.py`, `report.py`, `build_trades.py`, `calibrate.py`, `recalibrate.py`.

## Responsibilities

- Realized outcomes against actual traded or quoted evidence.
- Capital accounting and report generation.

## Non-responsibilities

- **Recreate the selection logic used to choose trades** — `engine/v2/scoring` does it instead.
- **Use fitted vendor marks as a realized PnL source** — `engine/v2/ledger, from settlement evidence` does it instead.

## Public interface

The names other packages may import. Everything else is internal regardless of
underscore convention, and an import of a name absent from this list fails
`checks/package_readmes.py`.

_Nothing yet — the package is an empty skeleton. The first name added here is added to this list in the same commit._

<!-- public-interface: none -->

## Consumers

Which packages import this one, and for what. Checked against the import graph:
a claimed consumer that does not import, or an omitted one that does, is a
failure rather than a stale sentence.

_Nothing yet — no package imports this one. The first importer is added here in the same commit._

## Usage

No runnable example yet: phase 0 creates the package and writes no
production logic into it. The shortest real example lands with the first
public name, and is expected to run in under a second from frozen
fixtures.

## Testing

Tier 0 (`component_contracts.md` §15.3): seconds, from frozen fixtures, no
panel load, no network, no fitting. Fixtures live in the private
`fixtures/tier0/` corpus (`checks/tier0_corpus.py`), never in this repo — they
carry licensed quotes.

A negative control here looks like: corrupt one field of a frozen record, run
the comparator, and assert it names **this package's stage** and that field
path — not that "a row is red". A check that has never failed is not known to
work.
